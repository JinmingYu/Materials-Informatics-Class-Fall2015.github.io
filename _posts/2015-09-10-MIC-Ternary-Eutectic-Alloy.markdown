Slight processing variation of a metal alloy can yield entirely different microstructure patterns. Microstructure has a direct influence on material properties, and therefore it is crucial to know how process affects the materialâ€™s properties. This project will focus on the Process-Structure correlation of silver-aluminum-copper ternary eutectic alloy microstructure patterns during phase solidification.
